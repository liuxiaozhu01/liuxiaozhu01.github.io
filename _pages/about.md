Hi there 👋. This is Liu Zujing(刘祖靖), a Master student at [Captain](http://www.captain-whu.com/en/team/) in Wuhan University, China since 2023, advised by [Prof.Gui-song Xia](http://www.captain-whu.com/zh/person/xiaguisong.html) and [Prof.Yuan Gao](https://yuan-gao.net/). I obtained my bachelor degree in Computer Science and Technology also in Wuhan University and got the honor degree from Hongyi Honor College.

I’m currently working on model compression and acceleration, including:
- 🔭 Pruning Language Model and Multi-modality Model.
- 🖥️ Inference acceleration of LLMs and MLLMs.
